\subsection{Liability and hosting by Contractor}
%-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

  \item \textbf{Limitation of liability.} The Contractor has no liability for deployment, third-party services, or the Client's use of the code or deliverables when the Client hosts or deploys the work. The Contractor is not responsible for any loss, damage, or claim arising from how the Client deploys, operates, or uses the work or from any third-party services or systems.

  \item \textbf{Hosting by Contractor---liability and charges.} If the Contractor hosts the project (staging or production), the Contractor is liable for those deployments. For both staging and production servers, usage-based charges will be collected by the Contractor; the rates or basis are set out in the Amendment to this Agreement and may change in the future. For production only, an additional service charge will apply for the production application; the amount or basis will be determined in a future amendment. This Agreement only covers staging and production stress testing. Real (live) application hosting is outside the scope of this Agreement; if the Client requires hosting of the live production application, it shall be agreed in a separate agreement, and the charges for such hosting must be agreed separately.
