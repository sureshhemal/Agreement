\subsection{Liability and hosting by Contractor}
%-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

  \item \textbf{Limitation of liability.} The Contractor has no liability for deployment, third-party services, or the Client's use of the code or deliverables when the Client hosts or deploys the work. The Contractor is not responsible for any loss, damage, or claim arising from how the Client deploys, operates, or uses the work or from any third-party services or systems.

  \item \textbf{Hosting by Contractor---liability and charges.} If the Contractor hosts the project, the Contractor is liable for those deployments. For staging applications, the Contractor will charge based on usage; those charges are not set out in this Agreement and will be agreed or quoted separately. The plans set out in the Amendment (Plan 1, Plan 2, Plan 3) are available for production applications only. For QA environments, charges are lower than for production and will be agreed or quoted separately.
