  \item \textbf{Force majeure.} Neither party shall be in breach of this Agreement if they cannot perform due to events outside their reasonable control (e.g.\ natural disaster, pandemic, war, government action, severe outage). The affected party must notify the other as soon as practicable. Obligations may be suspended while the event continues. If the event continues for an extended period (e.g.\ more than 30 days), the parties may agree to terminate or adjust the Agreement.
