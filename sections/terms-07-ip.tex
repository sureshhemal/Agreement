\subsection{Intellectual property and confidentiality}
%-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

  \item \textbf{Intellectual property---ownership of work.} The Client owns all code and other deliverables produced by the Contractor under this Agreement and paid for by the Client.

  \item \textbf{Intellectual property---pre-existing IP.} The Contractor retains ownership of the Contractor's pre-existing tools, libraries, methods, and other intellectual property. Use of such pre-existing IP in the deliverables does not transfer ownership to the Client beyond the right to use it in the delivered work.

  \item \textbf{Confidentiality.} The Contractor shall not disclose the Client's confidential information or the internal details of the Client's products to any third party. This obligation continues after the project or Agreement ends; the Contractor is not permitted to expose the inside story of the products even after the project is completed.
