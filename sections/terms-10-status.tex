  \item \textbf{Independent contractor.} The Contractor is not an employee of the Client. No employment benefits (e.g.\ leave, insurance, EPF) apply. The Contractor is responsible for the Contractor's own taxes and uses the Contractor's own equipment and tools unless otherwise agreed in writing.

  \item \textbf{Scope changes.} Any change to the scope of work must be agreed in writing. Scope changes may affect the timeline and cost, to be agreed between the parties.

  \item \textbf{Other work.} The Contractor may perform other work for other clients or on other projects, provided there is no conflict of interest with this engagement.
