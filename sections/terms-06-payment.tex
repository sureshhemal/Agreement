\subsection{Payment and late payment}
%-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

  \item \textbf{Payment.} The Contractor shall submit an invoice at the end of each month. Each invoice must be accompanied by a time track (timesheet) of the work performed. The due date is the invoice date plus 7 calendar days (calendar days; no exclusion for weekends or holidays). The due date shall be stated on the invoice.

  \item \textbf{Late payment.} Payment is due by the due date (invoice date + 7 calendar days). If paid on or before the due date, no late fee applies. If paid after the due date, a late fee of 2\% of the invoice amount per calendar day applies for the full number of calendar days since the invoice date (i.e.\ including the grace period from invoice date to due date). For example: paid on the 8th calendar day after the invoice date = 8 $\times$ 2\,\% = 16\,\% of the invoice; paid on the 10th = 10 $\times$ 2\,\% = 20\,\%. If payment has not been received within 7 calendar days after the due date, the Contractor may pause work until the outstanding amount is settled. If payment remains outstanding after 14 calendar days after the due date, the Contractor may withhold further work until the amount due (invoice plus applicable late fee) is paid. Both parties are encouraged to communicate promptly if any difficulty with the payment schedule is anticipated.
